# Open
- Add smart groups.
  - Selecting certain entities with a intuitive group will create a deconstruction planner for the entire group.
  - On a different hotkey (Shift + D)
  - Groups:
    - Transport Belt: belts, underground belts, splitters
    - Rail: rails, signals (Chain and normal), train stops
    - Support: rail supports, rail ramps
- Add ghost handling.
  - Default: Create ghost deconstructor.
  - With setting: Create deconstructor for underlying entity.

# Done
- Add pentapod shell support.
  - Currently, selecting a pentapod shell results in a tree deconstructor.
  - Selecting such shell should create a deconstructor with all 3 shell types.
- Add rail support.
    - Selecting any rail should always create a "straight rail" deconstruction planner, which innately includes curved
      and diagonal rails.
